You are given an array of N positive integers.
We define the score of a continuous subarray of length K as the sum of its top M elements.
Your task is to find the L-th minimum score.

Input
In the first line, there are 4 positive integers, N K M L.
N lines follow. The i-th of them contain the i-th element of the array.
It holds that N<=10^6, K<=N, M<=5, L<=N-K+1, and all elements are at most 2^63.

Output
The L-th minimum score.

Example
	Input
	5 3 2 2
	7
	4
	3
	9
	2

	Output
	12

	Explanation
	There are 3 different subarrays:
	[7 4 3] with score 7+4 = 11.
	[4 3 9] with score 4+9 = 13.
	[3 9 2] with score 3+9 = 12.
	The second minimum is 12.
