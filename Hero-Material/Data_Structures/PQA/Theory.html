<p>Sliding window minimum is an interesting algorithm, so I thought I would
implement it in a bunch of different languages. This repository contains (or
will contain) implementations of the algorithm in different programming
languages. What follows is an explanation of the problem and the algorithm.</p>

<div class="section" id="problem-introduction">
<h1>Problem Introduction</h1>
<p>The algorithm is sometimes also referred to as the Ascending Minima
algorithm. I learnt the algorithm from a South African Computer Olympiad camp
some years ago. I couldn't find any references to it in any journal, however
there are some explanations on the Internet.</p>
<p>Given an array ARR and an integer K, the problem boils down to computing for
each index i: min(ARR[i], ARR[i-1], ..., ARR[i-K+1]). The algorithm for this
"slides" a "window" of size K over ARR computing at each step the current
minimum. In other words the algorithm roughly follows this psuedocode:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">for (i = 0; i &lt; ARR.size(); i++) {
  remove ARR[i-K] from the sliding window
  insert ARR[i] into the sliding window
  output the smallest value in the window
}
</pre>
<p>The sliding window algorithm does the remove, insert and output step in
amortized constant time. Or rather the time it takes to run the algorithm is
O(ARR.size()).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naive-algorithms">
<h1>Naive Algorithms</h1>
<p>Before I explain the O(1) solution for sliding window minimum, let me explain
some alternative solutions which are suboptimal. The most straight-forward
solution is for each index i in ARR, simply loop over the values from
ARR[i-K+1] to ARR[i] and keep track of the minimum:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">void brute_force_time(std::vector&lt;int&gt; &amp; ARR, int K) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARR.size(); i++) {
     int min_value = ARR[i];
     for (int j = i - 1; j &gt;= min(i - K + 1, 0); j--)
        min_value = min(min_value, ARR[j]);
     std::cout &lt;&lt; min_value &lt;&lt; ' ';
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The above C++ code runs in O(NK) where N = ARR.size(). We can improve on this
by using a sorted set to speed up the minimum value queries to logarithmic
time:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">void logarithmic_time(std::vector&lt;int&gt; &amp; ARR, int K) {
  std::multiset&lt;int&gt; window;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARR.size(); i++) {
     window.insert(ARR[i]);
     if (i - K &gt;= 0)
       window.erase(window.find(ARR[i - K]));
     std::cout &lt;&lt; *window.begin() &lt;&lt; ' ';
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The window can have at most K elements, so the multiset insert, find and begin
operations all take time O(logK). This gives us an overall time of O(NlogK).</p>
<p>We can improve the run-time by a constant factor by using a heap instead. All
the heap operations (except finding the minima) have the same run-time
complexity as the multiset versions, however heaps empirically perform
better. We need to be able to remove arbitrary items in the heap, but the
implementation of heaps in C++ (std::priority_queue) does not support this
operation. Luckily a technique I have mastered in real life helps us get
around this: we delete lazily. For each element in the priority queue we also
store what index it was inserted from. Then when we query what the smallest
element is, we discard it if its index falls out of range of our current
window.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">void logarithmic_time2(std::vector&lt;int&gt; &amp; ARR, int K) {
  // pair&lt;int, int&gt; represents the pair (-ARR[i], i). We use -ARR[i] since
  // priority_queue is by default a max-heap, but we want a min-heap. By
  // negating the value on insertion and removal we get a min-heap. One can
  // also use the rather ugly
  // std::priority_queue&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;,
  //                      std::vector&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt;,
  //                      std::greater&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt; &gt;

  std::priority_queue&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt; window;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARR.size(); i++) {
     window.push(std::make_pair(-ARR[i], i));
     while(window.top().second &lt;= i - K)
       window.pop();
     std::cout &lt;&lt; (-window.top().first) &lt;&lt; ' ';
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that deleting lazily can actually make this algorithm perform rather
badly. If the input is N values from N to 1, then a value is never deleted
from the priority queue leading to O(logN) insertions. However, on average
this is empirically faster than the multiset version.</p>

<div class="section" id="sliding-window-minimum-algorithm">
<h1>Sliding Window Minimum Algorithm</h1>
<p>The idea of lazily deleting elements is a salient one, but by putting in a bit
more effort when inserting an element into the window we can get amortized
O(1) run-time. Say our window contains the elements {1, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2}. We
want to add the element 5 to our window. Notice that all elements in the
window greater than 5 will now never be the minimum in the window for future i
values, so we might as well get rid of them. The trick to this is to store the
numbers in a deque <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> and whenever inserting a number x we remove all
numbers at the back of the deque which are greater than equal to x. Notice
that if the deque was sorted before inserting, it will still be sorted after
inserting x. Since the deque starts off sorted, it remains sorted throughout
the sliding window algorithm. So the front of the deque will always be the
smallest value.</p>
<p>The front of the queue might have a value which shouldn't be in the window
anymore, but we can use the lazy delete idea with the deques as well. Now each
element of ARR is inserted into the deque and deleted from the deque at most
once. This gives as a total run-time of O(N) for the algorithm (amortized O(1)
per insertion/deletion). Pretty sweet:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">void sliding_window_minimum(std::vector&lt;int&gt; &amp; ARR, int K) {
  // pair&lt;int, int&gt; represents the pair (ARR[i], i)
  std::deque&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt; window;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARR.size(); i++) {
     while (!window.empty() &amp;&amp; window.back().first &gt;= ARR[i])
       window.pop_back();
     window.push_back(std::make_pair(ARR[i], i));

     while(window.front().second &lt;= i - K)
       window.pop_front();

     std::cout &lt;&lt; (window.front().first) &lt;&lt; ' ';
  }
}
</pre>

<h1>Extensions</h1>
<p>You can modify the algorithm by flipping &gt;= to &lt;= to get the sliding window
maximum algorithm.</p>
<p>In fact this algorithm works on any totally ordered set. So the elements can
be floats, sets, strings, etc. Essentially anything which has a &lt;= operator
that behaves "nicely".</p>
<p>Think you fully understand this algorithm, try solving these problems:</p>
