 you for this post! I was trying to help someone learning to program 
(though she does not plan to take only 24 hours for doing so...)<br>Two remarks content-wise though:</p><p>1)
 learning by doing is not necessarily the best or even the fastest way 
to learn, even though it definitely has its place. If I would teach 
anyone programming, I'd strongly recommend to study and try to 
understand good code; this would be the technique of 'worked examples'. 
So far, lots of 'worked examples' and a bit of problem solving seems to 
be better than one example followed by lots of problem-solving. (see for
 example <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fdiscover%2F10.2307%2F3233555%3Fuid%3D3738736%26uid%3D2%26uid%3D4%26sid%3D21104774888417%29%3A4qhZEjIxzJ-WECHx8BPryAI0NzA&amp;cuid=7373" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3233555?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104774888417)">http://www.jstor.org/discov...</a></p><p>2)
 The 10-year rule (or 10.000-hour rule) very much depends on the field; 
it used to be about 6 years for painters, but can be over 25 years for 
musicians. (Sternberg, Handbook of Creativity, around page 230) It tends
 to depend mostly on the competition in the field - the author of 
'Moonwalking with Einstein' became an US champion after about 1 year of 
training!. Assuming that a majority of programmers work hard at 
deliberate practice (which I doubt), it may indeed take 10 or 15 years 
to become a top programmer. But to be functionally literate and 'worth 
hiring' may not require that many years. Besides, one could definitely 
ask who is a 'top programmer': someone who can write code that is 
superbly simple and clear? Someone who can solve a complicated problem 
with a snazzy new polynomial algorithm? Someone who can keep track of a 
project involving millions of lines of code? Someone who knows hundreds 
of language functions and libraries? Someone who actually understands 
what a non-computer-scientist customer is talking about and can 
transform it into a solution? Not all programmers will be equally good 
in all of those things, being the 'best' programmer may therefore be 
like comparing apples and oranges.</p><p>For the rest, excellent post! It definitely contains material that I want to mull over some more...</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-73" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">73</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/qw17kk"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:1625924756"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-2918466242"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/jigarsinghrathore/" data-action="profile" data-username="jigarsinghrathore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="224394671" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/jigarsinghrathore/" data-action="profile" data-username="jigarsinghrathore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jigar singh rathore</a></span> </span><span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-1625924756" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Eric-Wubbo Lameijer</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-2918466242" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, September 26, 2016 2:31 AM">2 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>And

 You're putting a lot of people off programming. What if you can already
 program before you `learn`? Your mind already works that way, and 
someone showing you the basics it just makes perfect sense and you're 
coding in say 15 to 30 minutes. You'll probably not sleep that night, of
 excitement. Just absorbing the functions and APIs methods just fit. <br>Ok
 there's tons to `learn` to memorize like a parrot - but, the basics are
 also very simple - and it all was built on basic principles. It also 
makes sense as if someone has already done much the work for you to 
achieve your creative ideas.<br>Programming is also un-learning, the 
tech changes very rapidly. Very humbling. Can be very theoretical and 
mathematical. Philosophical. And very fun. An incredible field and 
science. <br>Some program like filling in a coloring book, the lines are already there. For some it is painting a blank canvas, infinite.<br>So it takes 15 minutes, to 10,000 hours to a life-time, decades and you're still learning every day.<br>Oh, and to put in 10,000 hours into programming can be done in 2 years, even faster do the maths.<br>Kids master this. It can be as much taught as teaching someone to love.<br>There you go, don't take much of what people say for granted - you write the code, you write the rules you decide.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-29" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">29</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-13" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/tm7tgx"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:1790835441"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post minimized" id="post-2008566545"><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li></ul><div class="avatar"><div class="user"><img src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div></div><div class="post-body"><div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color"><p>This comment is awaiting moderation. <a href="#" data-action="reveal">Show comment.</a></p></div><header><div class="post-meta">This comment is awaiting moderation.</div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li></ul></header></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-2036284342"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar"><div class="user"><img src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span class="author">Joey Joeseph Michaels</span><span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-2008566545" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Francesco Basenghi</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-2036284342" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Wednesday, May 20, 2015 7:48 PM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>You

 missed the point of this entirely. While it's good to let people know 
coding isn't as easy as riding a bike, people that deter others from 
doing what they want to do is wrong regardless. How many times have I

whether freelance or working with an actual company and degree or no 
degree. Will they be a pro in 30 days from reading a book meant for

 don't agree with your expressed sentiments. I really take issue with 
your first statement. No it's not obvious, nor is it correct procedure

expressed opinion. If anything, it shows that YOUR brain requires more 
discipline and perhaps YOUR brain has a natural tendency to assert 
things it has no clue about. (whether TaoOfProgramming is a programmer

 be honest, the first time I programmed at 13 years of age, it just 
clicked, it was as if programming was the perfect vessel to express 
something I had in me.</p><p>As soon as I knew what the basic idea of 
programming is (series of instructions with flow control) and did some 
examples, endless abstract ideas came to my mind and were automatically 
converted into pseudo-code in my head, it was effortless and could not 
be stopped.</p><p>I remember coming back to my father that day and 
telling him during dinner: "I can do anything you can do" (he owned a 
software company, and no, he never sat down to teach me). Even though I 
only knew two flow control mechanisms IF and JMP, I could not think of a
 problem (lack of creativity probably) I could not solve with the tools I
 had (IF and JMP).</p><p>I've been stoked with programming ever since.</p><p>While
 I was not a master programmer at 13, learning a language's syntax and 
basic functionality triggered a lifetime of coding. I am a 31-year-old 
software engineer now and plan on being one for few more decades.</p><p>In
 my opinion, anything that gets you closer to becoming an expert is a 
Good thing, specially if it is a book that gives you a concrete set of 
tasks and schedule that will get you closer, since many people get stuck
 wanting to learn but never know where to start. However, I agree with 
Norvig that those books should be renamed to: "Learn basic 
&lt;language&gt; syntax and functionality in 21 days" (but that isn't a 
catchy title that would prompt many sales ;).</p><p>Finally, Norvig 
should also consider that whenever you have a large goal (mastering 
C++), it is always good to start with a small concrete task to work 
towards to (i.e. a 21-day plan to learn syntax and basic 
functionality!). Agile methodologies became popular precisely because 
they allowed small incremental deliveries towards a larger goal (a 
finished product).</p><p>Conclusion: 21 days books are a great starting point (so long as the book is well written).</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-1" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1e5cdwu"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3032284782"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-1886453018"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar"><div class="user"><img src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span class="author">rururu</span><span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-1790835441" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> TheTaoOfProgramming</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-1886453018" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Wednesday, March 4, 2015 5:45 AM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I agree.

 you. I've been interested in programming from very early ages (I 
suppose I'm still in my early ages, being only 13) mainly because my 
father is a programmer and I'm a pretty big gamer. Actually, It isn't 
just programming languages that I've been interested in. I'm also very 
interested and motivated to learn different languages, such as French, 
Spanish and Japanese (though I haven't quite gotten anywhere with them 
yet).</p><p>At first, my ideal was learning how to program Ruby, Python 
and Java within two or three years (not to the point of mastering them, 
but to the point of me having a proper understanding of the language and
 being capable of using the language in a way that doesn't scream 
"Novice!"). At first I was a little upset that it would take so long, 
but then realized that within that ten years I'd still be programming. 
It isn't a matter of learning for ten years, THEN doing it. It's a 
matter of learning as I go, for the period of ten years... and maybe 
even learning more after those ten years as I go. Really, I've been 
interested in this kind of stuff since I was six or so, and even tried 
learning some really basic stuff when I was (probably) nine. I'm 
thirteen now, and I've still been learning a few things. I could 
continue doing this for ten years, becoming more adapt with different 
programming languages. I have a Dad and an Aunt who'd be more then happy
 to help teach me some things long the way. I just need to spill in a 
lot more effort!</p><p>Much different to how I was thinking about this 
at first, I'm now much more motivated! I hope I'll keep to my word and 
learn within these ten years. ^_^ (I apologize for my lack of knowledge 
when it comes to grammar, especially with my misplacement of the words

 Peter, for this awesome post!  There are some great pointers to ways to
 practice that never occurred to me; and I've been programming for 
almost 20 years and have always considered myself as conscientious about
 improving my art.</p><p>Itzshak Stern has said 'Practice slowly' when 
asked what's the best way to learn to play the violin.  That advice has 
stuck to me for the last 3 months or so.  It jumped to me again when I 
read your emphasis on _deliberate_ practice.  But even with full 
attention, it would take 10K hours -- ars longa indeed.  On the other 
hand, the reward for long toil is always greater than that for the 
genius who gets it right away.  Not that I feel sorry for the genius. :)</p><p>p.s. Now about working on projects where one is the worst programmer ... any openings at Google right now? :)</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

 few ramblings from a middle aged tech guy. There is a reason why the 
very best books on the hard sciences are usually decades old and why 
publishers will never go broke with "24 hours" books. Everything is 
built on a solid foundation. Everything you learn needs to be actively 
integrated into your overall "information architecture" web of 
understanding. Something I read, Feynman I believe but my memory isn't 
what it used to be, stuck with me. People have difficulty with Physics 
because Physics is properly taught using the language of Mathematics. 
You can search for book after book after book that uses prose to 
"explain things differently", but it's an impossible task.</p><p>In this
 context, "A little programming knowledge is a dangerous thing" means to
 me that a trivial understanding of a single language's syntax isn't 
something you can build on to understand more complex problems than 
printing "Hello World!". You don't need to know everything up front to 
begin, but you DO need to realize everything you're learning initially 
is really miles deep. If you don't understand something, you're probably
 missing some pre-requisite and need to figure out what you need to 
learn, learn it and integrate it into your web. That process is painful 
and difficult. Did I mention it's painful? If you're not naturally 
gifted, I've found EE's tend to develop this talent...indeed it may be 
the most important thing you ever learn.</p><p>Mr. Norvig makes two 
excellent suggestions that I wish I'd heard 20 years ago and would 
recommend to anyone interested in CS. "Remember that there is a Computer
 in Computer Science". Read Horowitz and Hill's "The Art of Electronics"
 from cover to cover. Then learn 6 or 7 programming languages that each 
exemplify a different type of abstraction.</p><p>"May the road rise up 
to greet you, may the wind be always at your back, and may you be in 
Heaven an hour before the Devil knows you're dead."</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

 no. A paramedic does about a year of training at a college. 6-7 months 
if it is an actual academy, as evidenced by the U.S. Military's training
 like the SOCM course. Most paramedics might get their hand hold for a 
few months, but that is it. When I was a 68W in the ARNG, I could do 
crics, chest tubes, cut downs, etc after 5 weeks of "surgical" training.</p><p>That
 comparison was not all that valid. I do agree the title of this article
 should be ten years to be a professional industry developer. I know 
several biophysicists that do theoretical/computational work after 
CS1/CS2, perhaps a numerical analysis or comp physics course, and a 
class or two that needed some coding in undergrad. After a year of grad 
work, most can write highly effective programs/scripts for various 
tasks. That is maybe, at most, two years of coding in UG work and 1-2 
years of coding in grad work. Somehow they make effective models. Is 
there code perfectly organized, the most efficient, and easily 
maintainable? Depends on the person.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1awnbhk"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2836279784"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-3179680992"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/miketamillow/" data-action="profile" data-username="miketamillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="119922377" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/miketamillow/" data-action="profile" data-username="miketamillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tamillow</a></span> </span><span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-1637246342" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Eduardo</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#comment-3179680992" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Tuesday, February 28, 2017 8:40 PM">a year ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>No it doesn't, not at all.
